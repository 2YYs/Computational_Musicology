Acoustic Features over Time: 'Here Comes the Sun' (The Beatles)
The chromagram visualises the harmonic content of this classic Beatles track. You can clearly see a distinct structural shift representing the Verse-Chorus-Verse form. In the "Verse" sections (frames 1-30 and 61-100), a specific set of pitch classes is highly active, representing the bright acoustic guitar progression. In the "Chorus" section (frames 31-60), the harmony notably shifts.

The cepstrogram confirms this structural change through timbre. During the middle chorus section, there is a distinct change in the lower MFCC coefficients, which visually represents the shift in instrumentation—specifically, the introduction of the Moog synthesizer and the denser vocal harmonies that give the chorus its fuller texture.

Comparing Chroma vs. Timbre Self-Similarity Matrices
By comparing the two SSMs for 'Here Comes the Sun', the pop structure of the song is highly visible, appearing as a classic checkerboard pattern. The dark main diagonal line shows the track comparing perfectly to itself in real-time.

Chroma SSM: The harmonic structure is exceptionally clear. The dark off-diagonal blocks clearly show that the first verse (frames 1-30) is harmonically identical to the second verse (frames 61-100). The sharp edges of these blocks indicate sudden, clean chord changes.

Timbre SSM: The timbre-based SSM also shows the Verse-Chorus-Verse structure, but the blocks are slightly noisier and less sharply defined than the chroma matrix. This reflects the reality of the recording: while the exact chords of the verses repeat perfectly (captured by chroma), the specific sonic texture, drum dynamics, and vocal nuances (captured by timbre) vary slightly throughout the performance.
